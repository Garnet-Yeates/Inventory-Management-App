# Setting up this app to run on your computer

## Prerequisites

### General Workloads

You will definitely want to have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to run our application. Its integrated terminal makes it easy to have a split-view between client and server and it has many
features such as syntax highlighting, some compile-time error detection, auto completion, and ability to open different folders in different windows/screens.

### Database Workloads

For our database we use MySQL. It is preferred to use MySQL workbench since it is easy to use and user-friendly

There is an [installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=518835) for it linked here that should be able to install workbench with all of the required workloads:
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Shell 
- MySQL Router
- MySQL Connectors

### Server workloads

To be able to run the server, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) since it is the runtime environment that our server works on. 

### Web-App

To run the web-app you will also need Node.js (linked above) since React is also built as a Node package.

## Forking the repository

Create a [fork](https://github.com/Garnet-Yeates/Inventory-Management-App/fork) of this repository using the embedded link or clicking the `Fork` button on the top right of the main github page here. This requires you to have
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), although you could also just [download the zip](https://github.com/Garnet-Yeates/Inventory-Management-App/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) for the repository using this link or the green `Code` 
button on the main github page.

## Opening With VS Code

Once you have forked the repository (or downloaded and extracted the source code), you should have access to a main folder called `Inventory-Management-App`. Right click on this folder and press "Open with VS Code".

Once you have opened it up in VS Code, your file structure should look something like this
